#dcs-get
Utility (based on expect) to get the files on the SD card of a Dlink *dcs-942l* (and possibly others).

* Only uses telnet.
* telnetd must be started on the camera using this command (where _dcs-942l_ is the ip address of the camera):
```
curl  --user admin:110684sa --referer http://dcs-942l/it/mainFrame.cgi http://dcs-942l/cgi/admin/telnetd.cgi?command=on
```
